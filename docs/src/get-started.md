# Getting Started

## Installation

To use Turing, you need install Julia first and then install Turing.

### Install Julia

You will need to install Julia 1.0, which you can get from [the official Julia website](http://julialang.org/downloads/).

### Install Turing.jl

Turing is an officially registered Julia package, so the following will install a stable version of Turing while inside Julia's package manager (press `]` from the REPL):

```julia
add Turing
```

If you want to use the latest version of Turing with some experimental features, you can try the following instead:

```julia
add Turing#master
test Turing
```

If all tests pass, you're ready to start using Turing.
